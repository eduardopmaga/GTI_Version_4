TIMx_CCMR1 - p983


Forced output mode
In output mode (CCxS bits = 00 in the TIMx_CCMRx register), each output compare signal
(OCxREF and then OCx/OCxN) can be forced to active or inactive level directly by software,
independently of any comparison between the output compare register and the counter.
To force an output compare signal (OCXREF/OCx) to its active level, user just needs to
write 0101 in the OCxM bits in the corresponding TIMx_CCMRx register. Thus OCXREF is
forced high (OCxREF is always active high) and OCx get opposite value to CCxP polarity
bit.
For example: CCxP=0 (OCx active high) => OCx is forced to high level.
The OCxREF signal can be forced low by writing the OCxM bits to 0100 in the
TIMx_CCMRx register.
Anyway, the comparison between the TIMx_CCRx shadow register and the counter is still
performed and allows the flag to be set. Interrupt and DMA requests can be sent
accordingly. This is described in the output compare mode section below.
