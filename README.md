# GTI_Version_4
The hardware and software files for the GTIv4 that ended in a huge explosion and a ruptured MASTERGAN2...

We got as far as implementing a PR controller which was working well at 30V into a 6ohm load. I then applied 380V to the DC bus and things were working well. I then increased the current output and at about 360Watts it cut out (suspiciously). I carelessly reset the microcontroller and reapplied power - Bang!
